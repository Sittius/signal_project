The initial state starts with the monitoring system monitoring patient data. This system transitions when an alert worthy condition is detected.
In that case, an alert is generated, the system transitions to send the alert to the staff. The staff receives this message and the system then transitions
by the staff acting on the alert.
Once acted upon, the system transitions back to the initial state where the monitoring system goes back to monitoring data until an alert is generated again.
