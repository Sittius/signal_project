The PatientRecord class stores data for a specific patient. This data is managed by the DataStorage class that is also central for the PatientData class.
The IdentityManager makes sure that the user/client that is requesting the data is actually valid. So it checks if the patient ID exists and if it has access to the data.
The manager passes on teh ID to the PatientIdentifier, which requests the data for the specific patient from the PatientRecord class.
