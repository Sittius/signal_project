There are three possible types of data that this system can handle: Files, WebSocket data and TCP data.
These classes listen for patientdata in there respective data types.
If they detect an event, this data is sent to the DataParser, which standardizes all three types to one specific one which the following class is expecting.
The DataSourceAdapter takes the standardized data and either processes it further, or stores it in the DataStorage class that is central in the patientData system.
