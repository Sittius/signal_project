The patient monitoring system waits until it detects an alert worthy situation. Then an alert is sent to the DataStorage class, which passes it to the AlertGenerator class.
From here the alert is saved in the DataStorage class and a further signal is sent to the AlertManager. This Manager actually sends the alert the staff system, who act on the alert.
The patient monitoring system is an agent and should not have a time over which it is active, but the software did not let me remove the active bar, without removing the "check on" message.
